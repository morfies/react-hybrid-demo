# ssr demo

This demo is a forked version of github react-ssr-example.

I am using this to test v18 ssr. V18 has stricter hydration content mis-match checking, for example, you can return an extra `div` from server html to see the error message.

And test other things:

- https://gist.github.com/gaearon/e7d97cdf38a2907924ea12e4ebdf3c85
- Suspense will generate `<!--$-->` comment separator
- v18 with new APIs has stricter hydration content match checking, can try to add an extra `div` layer from ssr html to see the error.
- If using v18 still with old v17 APIs, the whole app actually just stays in v17 logic, no v18 features are introduced, including stricter checking or auto-batching etc.
- CSR is v18 based and build the dist first, then we switch server to v17 and then build server only, then we start the server. This way we test if hydration compatable between versions.
  - v17 domServer doesn't support `Suspense`

## scripts

#### `npm start`

This is to start the static dev server for the app. Namely if you want to see only CSR in action, use this command.

#### `npm run build`

This is to build the static app and outputs are stored in `dist/` folder:

- bundle.js: our client side js bundle file, including app code and react as such libraries.
  > This is also the bootstrapScripts for ssr `renderToPipeableStream`.
- index.html: this is the app's entry html with our bundle.js injected
  > Only used for CSR case.

> I intentionally bundle with `development` mode to better see error messages for local development.

#### `npm run dev`

This will build our client side code and server side code for this app, and then start the server.

After this command, you can visit our hybrid app at localhost:3006

#### `npm run dev:build-server`

This is to build server code into `server-build/index.js`,
then we can run `npm run dev:start-server` to start the express server locally to serve ssr html.

The served html is from `./dist/index.html`, which has our client-side `bundle.js` injected already. So after been loaded, client-side bundle will do the hydration upon calling `hydrateRoot`.

## How to start Hybrid

- First run `npm run build` to build our `bundle.js` into `dist/` folder
- Then run `npm run dev:build-server` to build server bundle into `server-build`
- Finally run `npm run dev:start-server` to start our server
- Visit `localhost:3006/` to see our hybrid application

## webpack

- webpack.config.js is used for csr
- webpack.server.js is used for ssr

## Improvement

### Basic

In the server, we use `ReactDOMServer.renderToString` to render our app to html and return.

This way has a few pitfalls:

- Server only returns when the whole app finishes rendering, namely slow data fetching if any in parts of the app can slow the whole process down.
- Client side needs the whole app's bundle.js to do hydration, namely before becoming interactive, a large bundle.js file needs to be downloaded and loaded.

We can try to improve this by using v18 streaming and Suspense.

> Streaming: In HTTP streaming, data is sent as a continuous stream, allowing the client to start processing data as soon as it is received, without waiting for the entire payload to be transferred. This enables low-latency delivery and real-time interaction.

### Advanced

(https://github.com/reactwg/react-18/discussions/37)

Things we want to add:

- Add more components with `Suspense` or `lazy`
  - Selective Hydration
- Use react-query for data-fetching
- Test if initial bundle is splited
- ~~Test if Suspense is streamed partially as expected and check the partial returned data(with js to hydrate this part of UI? From the doc, this is no, client js bundles can be splited by `lazy`)~~

  - The above is incorrect: streaming is an http protocol, namely only a single connection with the server, but data is sent continuously in a stream instead of in discrete packets.
  - In our example, if you visit ssr rendered `localhost:3006/article` page, you can see in network the document request is streaming in action, the request timeline actually lasts as long as our api returns, but the initial html is returned and rendered instantly. Here is the returned html that react can handle with it's suspense:

  ```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html lang="en">
    <head>
      <meta charset="utf-8" />
      <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
      <meta name="theme-color" content="#000000" />
      <title>React App</title>
    </head>
    <body>
      <div class="App">
        <div>
          <nav>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <a href="/">Home</a>
              </li>

              <li>
                <a href="/nothing-here">Nothing Here</a>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </nav>
          <hr />
          <!--$-->

  </div>
  <script>
    function $RC(a, b) {
      a = document.getElementById(a);
      b = document.getElementById(b);
      b.parentNode.removeChild(b);
      if (a) {
        a = a.previousSibling;
        var f = a.parentNode,
          c = a.nextSibling,
          e = 0;
        do {
          if (c && 8 === c.nodeType) {
            var d = c.data;
            if ('/$' === d)
              if (0 === e) break;
              else e--;
            else ('$' !== d && '$?' !== d && '$!' !== d) || e++;
          }
          d = c.nextSibling;
          f.removeChild(c);
          c = d;
        } while (c);
        for (; b.firstChild; ) f.insertBefore(b.firstChild, c);
        a.data = '$';
        a._reactRetry && a._reactRetry();
      }
    }
    $RC('B:0', 'S:0');
  </script>
  ```

  Interestingly, we can see the initial html only has our `fallback` loading content, along with a `template` indicating our suspense boundary, but later as the server finishes Suspense, another partial chunk is streamed, react will then replace our loading content with this newly rendered content.

  > At this point, actually our ssr is not perfect, you will see that even if our server has called api and got the data, once upon client hydration, the client will still send out api requests. This is not good at all.

  The jsx of this page:

  ```jsx
  <div style={{ border: '1px dashed gray' }}>
    <h1>This is an article page</h1>
    <Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>
      <Sunrise />
    </Suspense>
  </div>
  ```

- Test when Suspense failed ssr, how does csr kick in?
- Use `renderToPipableStream` api
  - How to make api calls happen in server only?
    > This is completed, let's explain in details at belowðŸ”½. The implementation is in `ReactQueryStreamedHydration`
  - Why the returned html seems been cached after the first visit?
    > Probably cached by `react-query`!
- If a hydration content mis-match error happens, the app will fallback to csr, meaning in this case, the whole csr bundle.js will take control and generate the DOM and event handlers totally.(The server can return absolutely different html than the client to test)

  - The first test: in `ServerEntry.js` add an extra shell layer html(a `div` for example), this will cause a mis-match with CSR thus an `hydration failure`. From the error and also the final html of the page we can tell that CSR is in action indeed.

    > Uncaught Error: There was an error while hydrating. Because the error happened outside of a Suspense boundary, the entire root will switch to client rendering.

  - The second test: cause a mis-match inside a `Suspense`. Normally I think this kind of mismatch is caused by explicitly control different behiver by using ENV variables such as `_SERVER_RENDER_ ? <A /> : <B />`. In our example, we can first build csr bundle.js then modify a component and then only build the server bundle to cause this mismatch. For example, I add an `extra static string` in our `Sunrise` component, since this component has a delayed api call, will only finish rendering after the delay, the `extra static string` will be returned and rendered initially, but after suspense resolved, the mismatch happens, then revert to csr, causing the `extra static string` to disapper.
    > Uncaught Error: There was an error while hydrating this Suspense boundary. Switched to client rendering.

# Take aways

## URLs(traditional vs hash)

You can see that multi-page apps(traditional urls) are usually achieved with hybrid mode,
for example, if you start the csr `npm start` and visit `http://localhost:3000/article` directly, you will encounter with page not found error.
This is because the server has no such path `/article` only `/` which serves `index.html` file. We are only using `BrowserRouter`, meaning all the routers are client-side routing.

SPA works with hash routes, meaning the server always receives `/` path, leaving the client js to resolve the hash part and then render the correct page compoment.

## MPA

During the testing process, after I switched to `renderToPipeableStream` with hybrid mode, I found that even if I killed the server, che client pages can work normally as if an SPA, whithout requesting the server anymore(no api involved).

## http headers(CSR vs SSR-streaming)

- csr

```text
  Accept-Ranges: bytes
  Connection:keep-alive
  Date:Tue, 02 Apr 2024 06:12:13 GMT
  Etag:W/"196-+O0uBHqI7J6BBg8u60qIx52req0"
  Keep-Alive:timeout=5
  X-Powered-By:Express
```

- ssr

```text
  Connection:keep-alive
  Content-Type:text/html
  Date:Tue, 02 Apr 2024 06:24:08 GMT
  Keep-Alive:timeout=5
  Transfer-Encoding:chunked
  X-Powered-By:Express
```

In streaming scenarios, 'Transfer-Encoding: chunked' is commonly used to transmit data in smaller, more manageable pieces. Each chunk is preceded by its size in hexadecimal format, followed by a carriage return and line feed, the chunk data itself, and another carriage return and line feed. The final chunk is followed by a zero-sized chunk to indicate the end of the data stream.

This mechanism enables efficient streaming of large media files or data streams over HTTP, as it allows the server to start sending data to the client as soon as it becomes available, without needing to buffer the entire content in memory or on disk before transmission. It also facilitates better utilization of network resources and supports streaming scenarios where the total content length may be unknown or dynamically generated.

## SSR only happens for the first page visited

If you first visit `/` homepage, then click link to go to `/article`, namely by client-side navigation, you will see that no more document requests are sent to server. This means once our first page is requested(document along with our bundle.js), the following navigations are client-side-rendering and client-side navigation only. Unless you refresh the page, which will request from server again and thus SSR returned.

## How to avoid client re-calling APIs for SSR?

### The situation here is

In our `/article` page, we used `Suspense` to split our components into different parts, each calls a long-time-response api to get data.

Without wrapping `ReactQueryStreamedHydration`, the ssr returned html schema will be like above posted html content.

But, if we refresh the page, we can see both server and client will call apis as if the client doesn't know the server has already got the data. This is true.

Before we go into details, let's post a final html schema after wrapping with `ReactQueryStreamedHydration`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />

In this schema we can see extra content as `window['__RQ:R2:']`, this is how our client `react-query`(SDK) will recognise and thus know "wow, the server has the data now, I no need to call apis again!".

### High-level Explanation

React(`v18.2.0`) itself only takes care of the streaming and concurrent rendering, once a suspense boundary resolves, it streams the extra chunk to client. That's all!

We are using `@tanstack/react-query@5.28.14`(support suspense) as our fetch SDK, so the sdk itself somehow needs to handle the apis correctly and if the query is called in server, the client needs to know this thus avoid duplicate calling.

### Details about `ReactQueryStreamedHydration`

The SDK exports two HoC components:

- `StreamableContext`
  > This is used to wrap our root server component and process(hijack) the stream data returned by `renderToPipeableStream` and inject with server data hydrated into final html schema
- `ReactQueryStreamedHydration`
  > This is used to wrap our `App` and listen on `queryClient` to track all the queries happened in our Suspense boundaries, `dehydrate` the data on the server and then `hydrate` the data on the client, this way the client SDK gets to know the data has been called already.
